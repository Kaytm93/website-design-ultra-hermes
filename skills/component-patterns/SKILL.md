# Component Pattern Router

Select patterns after direction, content hierarchy, and state requirements are known.

## Read only the needed family

| Request | Reference |
|---|---|
| Hero, section composition, editorial layout, sticky story | [references/heroes-and-sections.md](references/heroes-and-sections.md) |
| Bento, feature grid, cards, visual demos, data stream | [references/bento-and-cards.md](references/bento-and-cards.md) |
| Navigation, form, modal/dialog, toast, interaction shell | [references/navigation-forms-overlays.md](references/navigation-forms-overlays.md) |

Do not load all three for a single component.

## Selection rules

- Match the content shape before the aesthetic label.
- Use `content-design` first when claims, proof, labels, or state copy are unresolved.
- Use one signature pattern per viewport; let supporting sections become quieter.
  A signature is a specific describable device, not a component choice:
  `style-directions/references/signature-moves.md` catalogues them, each with the
  invariant it must not break.
- For full pages or signature sections, load `core-rules`’ responsive recomposition and composition-contract references, then define viewport-specific priority, media, and interaction.
- Prefer semantic structure and natural document flow.
- Every hover/pointer effect needs focus and touch behavior.
- Persistent motion needs reduced-motion and pause behavior.
- Apply `ui-states` only when the component owns relevant async, validation, mutation, or interactive state.

## Composition checks

- Does the pattern clarify the primary action?
- Is the mobile composition reprioritized while DOM, visual, and focus order remain coherent?
- Can the layout survive longer copy, localization, and missing media?
- Does it still work without animation, hover, or JavaScript enhancement?
- Are cards actually grouping related content?

## Output

Return the selected pattern, semantic structure, responsive behavior, applicable states, and only the dependencies it needs.
