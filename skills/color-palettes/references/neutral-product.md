# Neutral and Product Palettes

Use one palette. Values are calibrated for the listed default background/action pairing; recalculate contrast after adaptation.

A name here is the direction it belongs to, not the named product's token file.
These values are re-derived to pass the state-contrast contract, so `border` is
louder than the hairline those interfaces actually use. That is the price of a
boundary that meets 3:1 — use `divider` for lines that only separate.

## 1. Linear Mono

```yaml
bg: "#0a0a0a"
surface: "#171717"

on-action: "#052e24"

disabled: "#a1a1aa"
```

Use: productivity, developer tools, dark SaaS.
