# Expressive Palettes

Use one palette. Supporting colors are decorative unless a semantic role is explicitly assigned.

`border` is the 3:1 boundary token and is louder than a decorative rule; use
`divider` for lines that only separate. Brutalist and Neo-Memphis are the
directions where the loud border is the point — there, `divider` is the exception.

## 1. Cyber Cockpit

```yaml
bg: "#000814"
surface: "#001d3d"
border: "#7ea2c8"
divider: "#113a63"
text: "#ffffff"
muted: "#7ea2c8"
action: "#ffc300"
on-action: "#000814"
focus: "#ffc300"
danger: "#ff8a80"
on-danger: "#000000"
disabled: "#7ea2c8"
```

Use: aerospace, technical gaming, dense dark interfaces.

## 2. Brutalist Shock

```yaml
bg: "#ededed"
surface: "#ffffff"
border: "#0f0f0f"
divider: "#cfcfcf"
text: "#0f0f0f"
muted: "#4a4a4a"
action: "#ff5e3a"
on-action: "#0f0f0f"
focus: "#0f0f0f"
danger: "#9f1239"
on-danger: "#ffffff"
disabled: "#4a4a4a"
decorative: ["#a7f432"]
```

Use: agencies, music, streetwear. Choose orange as action; green is decorative or vice versa, never both as CTAs.

## 3. Y2K Chrome

```yaml
bg: "#c0c0c0"
surface: "#ffffff"
border: "#404040"
divider: "#9a9a9a"
text: "#000000"
muted: "#404040"
action: "#c70068"
on-action: "#ffffff"
focus: "#c70068"
danger: "#991b1b"
on-danger: "#ffffff"
disabled: "#404040"
decorative: ["#78a800", "#0066cc"]
```

Use: fashion, music, nostalgia.

## 4. Cyberpunk

```yaml
bg: "#050505"

border: "#9ea3ad"
divider: "#26262e"
text: "#f5f5f5"
muted: "#9ea3ad"
action: "#00c4d8"
on-action: "#050505"

```

Use: education, festivals, bold brands.

## 6. Aurora Glass

```yaml
bg: "#134e4a"
surface: "rgba(255,255,255,.07)"
border: "rgba(255,255,255,.55)"
divider: "rgba(255,255,255,.18)"
text: "#f8fafc"
muted: "#cbd5e1"
action: "#2dd4bf"
on-action: "#042f2e"
focus: "#2dd4bf"
danger: "#ffb4ab"
on-danger: "#000000"
disabled: "#cbd5e1"
decorative: ["#0c4a6e"]
```

Use: premium tech and glass surfaces. Validate text against the actual composited background, not only the base color.
