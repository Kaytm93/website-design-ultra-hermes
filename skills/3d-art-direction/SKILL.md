description: Direct the visual language of a web 3D scene. Use for camera and FOV choices, cinematic composition, lighting dramaturgy, material hierarchy, color management, tone mapping, mobile reframing, spatial typography, or a deliberate poster frame before implementing Three.js, R3F, WebGL, or WebGPU.

# 3D Art Direction

Define a reproducible image first, then the technique. Use `immersive-3d` for justification and budget, `3d-runtime-quality` for runtime tiers, and this skill as the visual single source of truth.

## Art-direction contract

Fix exactly these decisions before writing scene code. The block below is the
schema, not the values. `fov: 38` is one filled example, not a default to
reuse; the ranges each key must be chosen from live in the references. A
contract filled from this block alone is unfilled rather than shortened, and a
plan or contract-only answer is exactly where that shortcut is tempting.

```yaml
visual-thesis: "Which statement does the space carry?"
hero-subject: "Primary object and recognizable silhouette"
camera:
  framing: "close | medium | wide"
  fov: 38
  position: [0, 0.2, 5.4]
  target: [0, 0.1, 0]
  near-far: [0.1, 40]
composition:
  subject-anchor: "right-center"
  dom-safe-area: "left 42%"
lighting: "soft top-left key, cool rim, restrained fill"
material-order: "hero > functional secondary > accent > environment"
color-output: "Linear-sRGB work, sRGB output"
tone-mapping: "installed-renderer mapping + locked exposure"
mobile-reframe: "portrait shot, closer camera, text above canvas"
spatial-type: "DOM-first; one decorative world label"
poster-frame: "same silhouette and message as live scene"
```

Justify deviations inside the contract instead of hiding them in scattered components.

## Workflow

A step that names a reference requires it before that step can be answered.
Answering the step from this file alone leaves it unfilled.

1. State a visual thesis and determine what must be recognizable after two seconds.
2. Fix camera, FOV, target point, silhouette, negative space, and DOM safe area. Read [references/camera-and-composition.md](references/camera-and-composition.md).
3. Stage light, material roles, color space, tone mapping, and exposure together. Read [references/light-material-and-tone.md](references/light-material-and-tone.md).
4. For every text layer, decide between semantic DOM, `<Html>`, `<Text>`, and the rare `<Text3D>`. Read [references/spatial-typography.md](references/spatial-typography.md).
5. Design at least one dedicated portrait shot; do not merely scale the desktop scene.
6. Choose the poster frame from the same composition. It may read as a deliberate key visual, never as a loading error.
7. Hand measurable quality hooks to `3d-runtime-quality` without changing the visual ranking of the scene.

## Invariants

- Keep exactly one camera source per state. Scroll, controls, and focus rig must not write simultaneously.
- On responsive changes, adjust FOV, distance, and object scale deliberately; do not use FOV as a substitute for composition.
- Limit `near`/`far` to the space actually needed in order to preserve depth precision.
- Use light as hierarchy: only the most important light may require dynamic shadows by default.
- Avoid equally loud materials. Transmission, strong emission, clearcoat, and iridescence are accents.
- Manage exposure and tone mapping in one place. Do not compensate for a wrong pipeline with arbitrary material colors.
- Keep meaningful text in the DOM and retain it in the poster/fallback state.

## Output

Deliver:

1. the visual thesis in one sentence,
2. the completed art-direction contract,
3. desktop, portrait, and poster composition,
4. light and material roles,
5. the smallest changeable hooks for camera, light, exposure, and spatial typography.

## Check

- [ ] FOV, camera distance, target point, and safe area are explicit.
- [ ] Desktop and mobile have different, intentional shots.
- [ ] Light guides the eye and has at most one primary shadow owner.
- [ ] Materials form a clear visual ranking.
- [ ] Color spaces, tone mapping, and exposure are fixed.
- [ ] Spatial text stays readable and semantically present in the DOM.
- [ ] Poster, reduced motion, and the live scene tell the same statement.
