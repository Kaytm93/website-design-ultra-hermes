# Scroll Immersion

Scroll should reveal spatial meaning, not merely move decoration.

## Choose one scroll master

| Need | Master |
|---|---|
| Native document plus smooth inertia | Lenis |
| DOM and Canvas timeline/pinning | Lenis + GSAP ticker/ScrollTrigger |
| Self-contained Canvas scroll area | drei `ScrollControls` |
| Canvas owns the viewport, no document scroll | a virtual scroll owned by the scene |

Do not run Lenis and `ScrollControls` as competing masters. A separate animation library may consume progress, but one source owns scroll time.

A virtual scroll replaces the document's scrollbar and with it the keyboard
behavior, scroll anchoring, and position restoration the browser provided.
Reimplement all three or choose a different master. It is only the right answer
inside a `canvas-first-architecture` build; a DOM page that removes its own
scrollbar has taken the cost without the reason.

Whichever master is chosen, publish exactly one progress value and one velocity
value. Systems, materials, and shaders read those. A shader deriving its own
progress from a second source is the same two-clock failure in a different
place.

## Lenis with GSAP

```tsx
'use client'

import { ReactLenis, type LenisRef } from 'lenis/react'
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react'
import gsap from 'gsap'
import { ScrollTrigger } from 'gsap/ScrollTrigger'

gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger)

export function SmoothScrollRoot() {
  const lenisRef = useRef<LenisRef>(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const reduce = matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')
    if (reduce.matches) return

    const update = (time: number) => {
      lenisRef.current?.lenis?.raf(time * 1000)
    }
    const sync = () => ScrollTrigger.update()

    gsap.ticker.add(update)
    gsap.ticker.lagSmoothing(0)
    lenisRef.current?.lenis?.on('scroll', sync)

    return () => {
      gsap.ticker.remove(update)
      lenisRef.current?.lenis?.off('scroll', sync)
    }
  }, [])

  return <ReactLenis root options={{ autoRaf: false }} ref={lenisRef} />
}
```

Import `lenis/dist/lenis.css`. Use `ScrollTrigger.scrollerProxy()` only for a custom/proxied scroll container that needs explicit getters/setters; it is not automatically required for root Lenis.

For a production preference toggle, respond to media-query changes and mount/unmount smooth scrolling rather than reading the preference only once.

## R3F ScrollControls

Use delta-based damping:

```tsx
import { Scroll, ScrollControls, useScroll } from '@react-three/drei'
import { useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber'
import * as THREE from 'three'

function Rig() {
  const scroll = useScroll()

  useFrame((state, delta) => {
    const progress = scroll.offset
    state.camera.position.z = THREE.MathUtils.damp(
      state.camera.position.z,
      6 - progress * 4,
      6,
      delta,
    )
    state.camera.position.y = THREE.MathUtils.damp(
      state.camera.position.y,
      progress * 2,
      6,
      delta,
    )
    state.camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0)
  })

  return null
}

<ScrollControls pages={3} damping={0.25}>
  <Model />
  <Rig />
  <Scroll html>{/* semantic sections */}</Scroll>
</ScrollControls>
```

Do not combine this rig with controls that also write the camera.

## GSAP section lifecycle

Use `gsap.context()` and responsive `gsap.matchMedia()`. Revert both on cleanup. Refresh ScrollTrigger after fonts, images, and layout-affecting assets settle.

## Reduced motion and accessibility

- With reduced motion: disable smooth scrolling, parallax, continuous scrubbing, and animated camera travel.
- Preserve native scrolling and jump between meaningful scene states.
- Keep headings, copy, links, and controls in semantic DOM order.
- Provide a visible pause/disable-motion control for persistent nonessential motion.
- Avoid long pinning on small screens; never trap keyboard or touch scrolling.
- Define a separate portrait shot and shorter choreography with `3d-art-direction`; do not scale the desktop camera path into mobile.

## Check

- [ ] One scroll master owns timing.
- [ ] Camera/object damping uses `delta`.
- [ ] GSAP/Lenis subscriptions and tickers clean up.
- [ ] Breakpoints use distinct choreography where needed.
- [ ] Portrait composition is a deliberate reframe, not a smaller desktop path.
- [ ] Native-scroll reduced-motion path preserves the story.
- [ ] Pinning does not obscure focus or trap input.
